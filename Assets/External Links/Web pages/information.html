        <br/>
        <p1>Q1: A firewall is a device that resides on a network. It monitors traffic coming in and going out of the network as well as prevents certain types of traffic from entering the network </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q2: Usually, a URL beginning with HTTPS is secure as it stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. The difference is that HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to encrypt its messages. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q3: A brute force attack is classified as an access attack which generally means the user of harmful techniques to try and gain access into a system or network. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q4: A zombie is a computer that has been infected with malicious code from an attacker that can be used remotely to carry out malicious tasks such as a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q5: DoS stands for Denial of Service. What this does is prevents user from access a resource on a network due to it being constantly flooded with traffic from an attacker. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q6: Malware includes different types of threats such as trojan horses, viruses, and worms. These malwares can really damage your system once your system gets infected. It is best to use anti malware or antivirus software to prevent this. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q7: DHCP snooping is configured on switches in a network and acts like a firewall for between a DHCP server and other parts of the network. What its role is, is to monitor all untrusted ports on a switch and make sure no spoofed DHCP packets are getting to its destination </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q8: Clicking on links sent in emails can be very risky as it can lead to phishing. Phishing is when someone pretending to be a legitimate company sends an email and that contains a link that redirects a user to a mock website looking like the legitimate company website. The user will then be prompted to give their personal information one way or another to the fake website. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q9: Backing up is important as it can reduce the risk of losing important data when working in a company. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q10: To cyber criminals, it doesnâ€™t matter whether or not the business is big or not. Most hackers attack a network for the fun of it, to test their own abilities. Therefore, it is not unusual for a hacker to target a smaller company as it may be less secure as compared to a bigger company. However it is also not unusual for them to target a larger company. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q11: Rogue access points allow attackers to gain unchallenged access into a network as it undermines the security of the network it is currently residing on. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q12: Cyber security is a practice and theory in which teaches the processes and technologies designed to mitigate attacks and prevent unauthorized access against networks, devices, data, and programs.</p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q13: Strong passwords are passwords that are hard to crack which therefore, prevents access into a system.</p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q14: Passwords that are left as its default setting are dangerous as it increases risk of attackers gaining access via guessing or brute forcing their way into the system. </p1><br/>
        <br/>
        <p1>Q15: Black hat hackers are hackers that attack organizations with malicious intent, or intent to destroy or delete data within that organization. </p1><br/>
